# Fake-News-Detector
Fake News Detector in Python is a powerful natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning tool that helps identify fake news or misinformation in online texts and articles. This project is essential to combat the spread of misleading information and promote information integrity in the digital age.

Features and Functionality:

Data Collection: The fake news detector can collect and analyze a large amount of texts and articles from different sources, such as social networks, news sites and blogs.

Text Preprocessing: Before analyzing, text is preprocessed to remove noise such as stopwords, punctuation and special characters.

Sentiment Analysis: The system performs a sentiment analysis to understand the polarity of the text, helping to determine whether it has an emotional charge that suggests disinformation.

Feature Extraction: Important features are extracted from the text, such as keywords, named entities, and topics.

Machine Learning Model: Uses a machine learning model, such as a Naive Bayes classifier, SVM, or neural networks, trained on labeled data to predict whether text is true or false.

Source Credibility Assessment: The system also checks the credibility of the original source of the news, considering its history and history of spreading misinformation.

News Classification: Based on previous analysis, the system classifies news into categories, such as "true", "false" or "questionable".

Friendly User Interface: The fake news detector can be accessed through an intuitive user interface where users can enter the news text or source URL for immediate analysis.

User Feedback: Users can also provide feedback on analytics, which helps improve system performance over time.

Benefits:

It helps combat the spread of false information and preserve the integrity of information in the digital age.
Empowers users to make informed decisions based on truthful news.
It can be used by journalists, media companies, educational institutions and anyone interested in verifying the veracity of the information they consume.
